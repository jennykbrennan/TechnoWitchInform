A new job, a new boss, an interesting old startup with sketchy motivations. What could possibly go wrong? ^^

Would you like to restore a saved game?

"You made it. and that's about the only good thing you can say about this first day on a new job. After realizing that the worn looking dirty warehouse at the end of the road actually was the place, you entered the building with a good amount of skepticism. As you shut the big metal door behind you, you really start to wonder. If it hadn't been for the rent being late this month and the guinea pig staring with such disspoinment at yu while refusing to eat the cheaper brand Hamster chow, you wouldn't even bother. 
^
But here you are. Shaved and polished, sort of. You do want to make a good impression but you're not sure you know what that means anymore. It was just dumb luck that you had a pair of clean jeans tucked away in a drawer. All things going to shit the last few years hadn't improved the fit any, but hopefully no one will notice a partially open fly beneath your oversized T. ^
And that was just the beginning."
