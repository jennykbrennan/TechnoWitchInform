A new job, a new boss, an interesting old startup with sketchy motivations. What could possibly go wrong? ^^

Would you like to restore a saved game?

"You made it. and that's about the only good thing you can say about this first day on a new job. After realizing that the worn looking dirty warehouse at the end of the road actually was the place, you entered the building with a good amount of skepticism. As you shut the big metal door behind you, you really start to wonder. If it hadn't been for the rent being late this month and the guinea pig staring with such disspoinment at yu while refusing to eat the cheaper brand Hamster chow, you wouldn't even bother. 
^
But here you are. Shaved and polished, sort of. You do want to make a good impression but you're not sure you know what that means anymore. It was just dumb luck that you had a pair of clean jeans tucked away in a drawer. All things going to shit the last few years hadn't improved the fit any, but hopefully no one will notice a partially open fly beneath your oversized T. ^
And that was just the beginning."

I am returning to traditional second person, present tense narrative in this game. As in 

"Watching the black rat scurry across the lunch table, you resist the urge to try to catch it and bring it home. You let it get on its way while looking more carefully at the cardboard box the little beast came out of. Battered and grimy, the box is the size of a something like a microwave. It's free from any labels or markings. The flap on the top are clumsily puzzled together to keep it closed."
>open box
"After a quick glance over your shoulder at Janine who seems unusually engrosed in her tablet to make sure she is still ignoring you, you carefully pull the flaps apart..."

For contributors:
You can clone this repository and add something interesting to this game if you wish. Perhaps I'll love it, perhaps it will spark ideas. Just be very clear on how you think it fits  into this so far very open story. I need to know why it would be an interesting part of the narrative. Puzzles, challenges, and objects do need to have a point to them, Puzzles for the sake of being puzzle doesn't work in my style of game.  

For testers.
Open an issue for each problem. Use quotes from gameplay. Spelling and grammar corrections are welcome. Ideas for the continued building of this world are very much welcome.

Wit the cabiot that TechnoWitch Inc is a completely different genre and my writing has changed and hopefully improved over the years.
